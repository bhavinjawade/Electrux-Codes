# Electrux-Codes

This is an INI based MySQL like server. (Although not using queries, it uses directly functions.
This, alongside INI_Client is a hobby project and is in NO way or shape, ready to be even tested correctly.

Please refrain from using this. But you are free to tweak and learn using it if you desire and even give
feedback and corrections.

Note:
	This uses SFML for networking and requires C++11 for it to work.
	
	Also uses INI_Parser library (In this repository) for the INI File interactions and management. (Server only)
